This is the tasks project for Assignment 1 for Algorithms and Data Structures course in Astana IT University made by Baubek Zhumabayev, SE-2215
Here is written the task and way of solvation of 10 problems in Assignment 1:
Problem 1 - You are given a number “n” and an array of “n” elements,
write the function that returns minimum of them.
How solved - through recursion and comparing each element of array with the minimum.
Problem 2 - You are given a number “n” and an array of “n” elements,
write the function that returns average of them.
How solved - through recursion and finding sum of all elements and dividing to the count of them.
Problem 3 -  You are given a number “n”, write the function for checking
whether“n” is prime.
