This is the tasks project for Assignment 1 for Algorithms and Data Structures course in Astana IT University made by Baubek Zhumabayev, SE-2215
Here is written the task and way of solvation of 10 problems in Assignment 1:
Problem 1 - You are given a number “n” and an array of “n” elements,
write the function that returns minimum of them.
How solved - through recursion and comparing each element of array with the minimum.
Problem 2 - You are given a number “n” and an array of “n” elements,
write the function that returns average of them.
How solved - through recursion and finding sum of all elements and dividing to the count of them.
Problem 3 - You are given a number “n”, write the function for checking
whether“n” is prime.
How solved - through checking all the criterias for number to be prime. For example, 1 and all numbers less than 1 are not prime.
Problem 4 - You are given a number “n”, write the program using recursion for
finding “n!”
How solved - through recursion to multiply n to n-1 to n-2 and so on.
Problem 5 - You are given a number “n”, write the function for finding n-th
elements in Fibonacci sequence using recursion. (Fn = Fn-1+ Fn-2).
F0= 0, F1 = 1.
How solved - through recursion to add numbers in Fibonacci sequence using (Fn = Fn-1+ Fn-2) formula.
Problem 6 - You are given numbers “a” and “n”, write the function that
returns “a^n”.
How solved - through recursion to get temporary value, which will be used in multiplying to get a power result
Problem 7 - You are given a number “n” and an array of “n” elements,
write the program that returns given array in reverse order.
