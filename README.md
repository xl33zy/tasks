This is the tasks project for Assignment 1 on topic of Recursion for Algorithms and Data Structures course in Astana IT University made by Baubek Zhumabayev, gorup SE-2215
Here is written the task and way of solvation for 10 problems from assignment:

* **Problem 1** - You are given a number “n” and an array of “n” elements,
write the function that returns minimum of them.    
How solved - through recursion and comparing each element of array with the minimum.


* **Problem 2** - You are given a number “n” and an array of “n” elements,
write the function that returns average of them.    
How solved - through recursion and finding sum of all elements and dividing to the count of them.


* **Problem 3** - You are given a number “n”, write the function for checking
whether“n” is prime.    
How solved - through checking all the criteria for number to be prime. For example, 1 and all numbers less than 1 are not prime.


* **Problem 4** - You are given a number “n”, write the program using recursion for
finding “n!”    
How solved - through recursion to multiply n to n-1 to n-2 and so on.


* **Problem 5** - You are given a number “n”, write the function for finding n-th
elements in Fibonacci sequence using recursion  
How solved - through recursion to add numbers in Fibonacci sequence using (Fn = Fn-1+ Fn-2) formula.


* **Problem 6** - You are given numbers “a” and “n”, write the function that
returns “a^n”.      
How solved - through recursion to get temporary value, which will be used in multiplying to get a power result.


* **Problem 7** - You are given a number “n” and an array of “n” elements,
write the program that returns given array in reverse order.    
How solved - through recursion to print every element in reversed order.


* **Problem 8** - You are given a string “s”, write the function for checking
whether “s” is all consists of digits.  
How solved - through recursion and checking the characters of string.


* **Problem 9** - You are given numbers“n” and “k”,write the program that
finds binomial coefficient.     
How solved - through recursion in binomial coefficient formula.


* **Problem 10** - You are given “a” and “b”, write the function for finding
GCD(a, b) using recursion.  
How solved - through recursion and % operator.
